    q: "How do I lease a DREC property in Dubai?",
    a: "Browse our offering by location, price, community and/or type. Book a viewing with our team. Choose your unit and secure the property immediately using our online deposit platform (or contact our leasing agents to carry the process forward). Submit your application and documents and complete the tenancy contract with the leasing team. We register Ejari and coordinate your move-in timings with building management.",
  },
  {
    q: "What documents do I need to apply?",
    a: "For individuals: passport, valid UAE visa and valid Emirates ID. For companies: trade license, authorized signatory documents and tenant IDs. Your leasing advisor will confirm the exact list.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need Ejari and how do I set up utilities & internet?",
    a: "Yes. This is the most important step in your guide to renting a home in Dubai. After your lease is signed we register Ejari, then you activate DEWA and the buildingâ€™s internet provider. Some buildings have a separate chiller provider. We share the contacts at handover. Tip: Ask your leasing advisor to confirm there are no outstanding DEWA or chiller bills on the unit. Any balance should be settled before you activate your own DEWA account.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the move-in requirements?",
    a: "Once your documents and required steps are complete, our team will issue a move-in approval and hand over the keys. This typically includes a signed lease, security deposit and initial rent paid, Ejari issued and utilities arranged. Depending on the building, you may need to schedule with security and provide a refundable moving deposit to cover any potential damages.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is rent paid and is there a deposit?",
    a: "Payments are made by post-dated cheques or bank transfer as agreed in your lease. A refundable security deposit is held until move-out inspection and final settlement.",
  },
